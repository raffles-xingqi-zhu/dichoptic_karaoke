Woke up slow, but you hit like a double shot
Running through my veins, baby, you’re a little too hot
Bittersweet kiss, yeah you’re trouble I can’t forget
Sip of your smile and I’m already in deep—no regrets


Every time you come around, I lose control
You stir me up like sugar in my soul
Try to play it cool, but boy, you know—
I’m wired on you, can’t let you go

‘Cause you’re my espresso
Strong and a little too bold
Speeding up my heartbeat
Waking up my world when it’s cold
You burn like a sunrise
I drink you in all night
Baby, you’re my espresso
Hit me with that high-high-high
